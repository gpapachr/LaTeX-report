# AI-Minimax

This is the LaTeX source file that creates the pdf report (in greek) for the [ai-minimax project](https://github.com/gpapachr/ai-minimax). It contains different "packages" that are very helpful for everyone who wants to write a text containing mathematics or algoritmic "subject", while it's a great example for those who try to write anything in greek language. I hope students who want to write their assignments using LaTeX find this file useful.
